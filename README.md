# Beyond the Gap: Women in Tech 👩‍💻

An analysis of the gender gap in the ICT sector within the European Union, exploring the journey from academic choices to professional employment.

> **Note**: While this documentation is in English, the project assets (Excel workbooks and the final presentation report) are written in **Italian**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the root causes of female underrepresentation in the technology sector. By analyzing the "leaky pipeline" phenomenon, the research tracks how gender disparity evolves from university enrollment to the labor market, comparing European data from 2013 to 2023.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Data Analysis**: Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning, Trend Analysis).
* **Data Visualization**: Datawrapper (Interactive Charts & Maps).
* **Presentation & Design**: Canva (Visual Storytelling).

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **The Academic Gap**: Women are highly represented in fields like Health and Education but show a significant drop-off in STEM and ICT programs.
* **Employment Trends**: While the total number of ICT specialists in the EU is growing, the percentage of women remains disproportionately low (averaging around 20%).
* **Regional Disparities**: Significant differences emerge when comparing EU member states, with countries like Bulgaria showing higher female participation compared to others like Italy or Czechia.
